See below to learn about some of my current projects. You can download a copy of my CV [here](./files/cv.pdf).

#### **Associations between fine particulate matter, extreme heat events, and congenital heart defects**  
I am working with environmental epidemiologist [Dr. Jeanette Stingone](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/js5406) for my master's research in Columbia's [Department of Epidemiology](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academics/departments/epidemiology). 

We are assessing the effects of maternal exposure to air pollution (PM~2.5~) and extreme heat events on congenital heart defects in offspring. Our research is part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study ([NBDPS](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/nbdps.html)), one of the largest studies of its kind in the US.

#### **Climate variation and under-5 acute malnutrition in Bangladesh**
I am also working with Columbia's International Research Institute for Climate and Society ([IRI](https://iri.columbia.edu)), a part of the [Earth Institute](https://www.earth.columbia.edu/).

Specifically, I am working with [Dr. Hannah Nissan](http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/profile/hannah-nissan/) and [Dr. Robbie Parks](https://robbiemparks.github.io/) to assess associations between climate events and child anthropometry at seasonal and sub-seasonal scales, with a current focus on Bangladesh. Here is a [poster](./files/poster.pdf) of our preliminary findings, which won first prize at the 2020 NYC [Clinical Climate Change Conference](https://clinicalclimatechange.com/2020).

My research with IRI is funded by [ACToday](https://worldprojects.columbia.edu/content/actoday), Columbia University's first [World Project](https://worldprojects.columbia.edu/).
