I'm currently a master's student in Epidemiology and Applied Biostatistics at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. My research with Columbia's [IRI](https://iri.columbia.edu/) focuses on using epidemiological and biostatistical methods to answer questions related to climatic exposures and environmental health.
