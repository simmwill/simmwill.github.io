I am a master's student in the Departments of [Epidemiology](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academics/departments/epidemiology) and [Biostatistics](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics) at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. 

My current research activities at Columbia include work with both the Department of Epidemiology and Columbia's [IRI](https://iri.columbia.edu/), part of the [Earth Institute](https://www.earth.columbia.edu). My current focus is the use of epidemiological and biostatistical methods to answer questions related to climatic exposures and environmental health.

For more information, see my [CV page](http://simmwill.github.io/cv), where you'll find more in-depth descriptions of my current projects.
